<h2>Getting Leaf</h2>Leaf is implemented as a Python
library, which is platform-independent. On the other hand, the LGL
compiler (lglc) is written in C++ and requires platform-specific
binaries. You need both the components (pyleaf and lglc) to use Leaf.

<h3>Getting lglc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Precompiled binaries are available
for <a href="downloads/lglc-linux32.zip">32-bit Linux</a>
and <a href="downloads/lglc-win32.zip">Windows</a>. The path to the
lglc binary must be included in the PATH environment variable.</li>
<li>C++ source package can be obtained from github:
<br><br>
$ git clone https://github.com/franapoli/lglc</li>
<br><br>
</ul>
<h3>Getting pyleaf</h3>
Three ways of getting pyleaf:
<ul>
<li>Pyleaf is present in PYPI. Pip users can install it with: <br><br>

$ pip install pyleaf
<br><br>
</li>

<li>The pip installation is based on a source distribution (including
installation script and documentation) that can be downloaded directly
from <a href="downloads/pyleaf-1.0.1b.tar.gz">here</a>.</li>
<li>Pyleaf sources are on github (docs
not included). In order to get pyleaf sources  with git:
<br><br>
$ git clone https://github.com/franapoli/pyleaf.git
<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<!--
For simplicity, different python modules are available for
different architectures, each containing the same Python sources but
specific <i>lglc</i> binaries.
<ul> <li>Linux x86:
for <a href="downloads/leaf-linux-x86-py27-1_0.zip">Python 2.6/2.7</a>
and <a href="downloads/leaf-linux-x86-py3-1_0.zip">Python
3+</a>.</li> <li>Ms Windows:
for <a href="downloads/leaf-win-py27-1_0.zip">Python 2.6/2.7</a>
and <a href="downloads/leaf-win-py3-1_0.zip">Python
3+</a>.</li> </ul> <br>

<h2>Current development version</h2>LPL sources are available on
git-hib at [to be added].
<br><br>

<h2>Installation</h2> Unzip the Leaf package and run the following
from the command line:
<div class='code'>
  <pre>python setup.py install</pre>
</div>

You may require root privileges.<br><br>

<h2>Other mandatory or suggested software</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>: <b>prerequisite</b>
  for Leaf. Leaf is currently developed and tested on
  Python <b>2.7.2</b>. The Python 3 version of Leaf has not been
  thoroughly tested at the moment but seems to work.
  <li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org">Graphviz</a>: <b>required</b>
  for the <i>publish</i> and <i>export</i> Leaf features. Make sure
  that you can correctly run the "dot" command from a prompt.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>: suggested scientific
  programming modules for Python.</li>
  <li><a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net">Rpy</a>: suggested as
